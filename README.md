# Pet-Health
## Motivation
For a hackathon I participated in we created a Pet Health app to determine if a users pet was healthy. 
For this, I built the entire backend using the .NET 6.0 framework in C#, alongside assisting in other areas. 
This project aims to formalize my backend work and provide an oppurtunity to learn and use React in the frontend 
(I am already familiar with JavaScript and our original product utilised bootstrap).

## MVP
For the minimum value product I aim to produce three core pages, a form page for entering pet information, a results page, and a general pet info page relating to its breed.

The form page will allow users to enter information about their pet, such as species, breed, weight, and age.

The results page will perform calculations to determine if the pet is healthy based on the given information alongside helpful information relating to its breed.

The general information page allows users to search the database finding health information of pets.

There will also need to be some form of navigation.
